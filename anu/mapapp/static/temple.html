        The Annamalaiyar Temple's speciality is its connection to the Pancha Bhoota Sthalas, representing the element of fire (Agni). It is located at the base of the sacred Arunachala hill, which is considered a physical manifestation of Shiva. Key features include its massive size, stunning Dravidian architecture with several gopurams, and the annual Karthigai Deepam festival, where a giant lamp is lit atop the hill.
